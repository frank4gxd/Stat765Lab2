## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

##Lab02 Assignment
```{r Lab02_1,echo=TRUE}
#tidy the dataset

source('./lab2ScriptR.R')
df <- sort_data()
#knitr::kable(head(df,20))

```
<span style="color:red;">
#for Task3_1

  The peak load are differed by the weather with the relations showed in the plot.
  The Pattern doesn't vary by office type.
</span>
```{r Lab02_2,echo=TRUE}
#get dataset for TASK3_1
dfSmall <- df %>% filter( group=='sensible_cooling' & description=='Outdoor Temperature at Peak Load [C]') %>% arrange(weather)
#knitr::kable(dfSmall)


ggplot(dfSmall,aes(x=value,y=weather,colour=office_type))+geom_jitter()+scale_colour_viridis_d()+facet_grid(~office_size);

```
<span style='color:red;">
#for Task3_2


The Office Size effects the total energy consumption.this is the most significant impact.
</span>
```{r Lab02_3,echo=TRUE}

df %>% filter(description=='Total Cosumption [GJ]') %>% ggplot(aes(x=value,y=weather,colour=office_type,shape=office_size))+geom_jitter()+scale_colour_viridis_d()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
